# COVID-19's Impact on Adults Mental Health

Francesca Stewart

Bio-sciences Department, Minnesota State University Moorhead

## Introduction

Mental health, which includes a person's emotional, physiological, and social aspects of their life. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and the changing world, our mental health has been impacted. To address this topic, we used datasets about SNAP, AMI (any mental illness) data, and poverty numbers. Our results may help us understand theeffect COVID-18 has on mental health. I am interested in how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Adults' overall mental health and well-being.

## Methods

I compared the following aspects; finance/income (poverty/food insecurity) US adult's lives before and after the pandemic to understand the impacts the pandemic had on mental health.

-   To get the food insecurity data, I went to the USDA website, and downloaded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) tables. .SNAP stands for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; it helps people with a low-income to buy nutritious food.

-   To get the poverty data, I went to the US Census website, and found the poverty data. Poverty is when someone has less income than needed to afford basic needs, and usually means you are extremely poor

-   To get the AMI data, I went to the Mental Health America (MHA, a nonprofit) website, and look at the 2016-2022 adult rankings. AMI stands for any mental health illness; for example, ADHD, Autism, etcetra.

According to the SNAP and poverty data sets, both poverty numbers and SNAP users were decreasing from 2016 to 2019 (fig, 1 and fig. 2). In 2020 (Jan. 2020 was 1st COVID case), we see both graphs shoot up, which I concluded was the result of the pandemic and financial uncertainties brought on by it.The AMI graph (fig. 3) includes data from 2016-2022. The numbers were going down from 2016-2018, and then rose up again in 2019. In the first year of COVID, 2020, we see the biggest spike in AMI's. Then in 2021, it goes up even more, and the again in 2022.

## Discussion

When COVID hit, many people lost jobs, childcare, and went into lockdown. For many, their financial status was impacted. Social, physiological, and emotional aspects of our lives were in jeopardy. Now add having to be on financial assistance. You can see why the number of AMI's increased, with COVID, poverty numbers, and SNAP users. Think about the following questions when connecting SNAP and poverty graphs to the AMI graph

What if you…..

couldn't eat daily?

had to live everyday cent to cent?

had to choose between having heat or water?

Would these things impact any emotional, physiological,and social aspects of your life?

To conclude, based off the data we collected from the SNAP users and the US Census Poverty levels that increased during 2020, this is a big reason for the increase in AMI numbers during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The impacts of COVID, can explain why Americas overall mental health has been getting worse. Once the pandemic is declared done and no one is experiencing COVID-19's affects, we expect to see poverty numbers and snap users decrease, which will hopefully help bring down the number of AMI's.
