COVID-19’s Impact on Adults Mental Health

An exploratory data anlysis for BIOL  275 Quan bio at MSUM

Mental health, which includes a person's emotional, physiological, and social aspects of their life. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and the changing world, our mental health has been impacted. To address this topic,  we used datasets about SNAP, AMI (any mental illness) data, and poverty numbers. Our results may help us understand the effect COVID-18 has on mental health. I am interested in how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Adults' overall mental health and well-being.
